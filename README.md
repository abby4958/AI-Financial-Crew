- Create custom local LLM made for CrewAI
  - Run the ./setup/create_llama2-model-file.sh       or 
            ./setup/create_llama2-model-file.sh
  script
    - Make this script executable by running `chmod +x ./setup/create_llama2-model-file.sh `
      or copy and paste commands into terminal
  - This will create a model file in the models directory
  - To change models, edit the create_model.sh script
